# Create Your Own Schema Registry 

Schemacher helps you have your own Schema Registry. 
Your team can create and maintain a JSON based Schema, which Schemacher uses to create client libraries in multiple languages and publish their respective packages. 
It avoids the problems caused by cross-team dependencies while dealing with Types.
